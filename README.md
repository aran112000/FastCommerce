FastCommerce: a fast, lightweight PHP e-commerce framework
===========================================================

FastCommerce is in the very early stages of development and as such major structural changes can be made without prior notice, we strongly advice against using in a production environment at this time.

If you would like to get involved in the development of FastCommerce then please feel free to get in contact with Aran via email: cdtreeks@gmail.com who is heading up the development.

Please feel free to submit pull requests for any bug bugs you find and fix.

We are using YouTrack for monitoring development progress so to see exactly what we're working on at the moment please visit out YouTrack here:
