FastCommerce: a fast PHP eCommerce platform
===========================================

FastCommerce is in the very early stages of development and as such major structural changes can be made without prior notice, we strongly advice against using in a production environment at this time.

FastCommerce is a fast eCommerce framework written in PHP and designed from the ground up for rapid development/deployment

If you would like to get involved in the development of FastCommerce then please feel free to get in contact with Aran via email: cdtreeks@gmail.com who is heading up the development.

Please feel free to submit pull requests for any bug bugs you find and fix.
